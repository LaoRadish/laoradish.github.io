The Mosuo People

Live on the banks of Lugu Lake in China – a remote region that is a 6 hour drive from the nearest city. Although called a matriarchal society, more accurate to call the Mosuo tradition matrilineal. In their society, women are heads of their households and make decisions about the family. They practice what is known as walking marriages, whereas Mosuo females can choose their lovers and have as many or as few as they want in their lifetime. Men and women do not live together and babies are reared exclusively in the women’s family with brothers and uncles providing the fatherly role. However, men still hold political power in wider society and are counted on for things like building, fishing and the killing of livestock. 
As for Religion, Mosuo society is based on an ancient religious system that is mixed with the more recent import of Tibetan Buddhism. They are traditionally animists and believe in the idea of a Mother Goddess.
